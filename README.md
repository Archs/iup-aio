# IUP-AIO

iup-aio aims the be an all-in-one dll for using [IUP][] in Windows.

*Attention* : Currently no support for iuptuio and iupwebbrowser in Windows.

----

*[IUP][]* is good for light weight cross platform GUI development.
But the library in dll form in Windows is a mess of lot of dlls, which
is not good for distribution.

----

# Contents

1. iup 3.8 source files for iup,iupim,iupcontrols,imppplot
2. im 3.8.1 static lib
3. cd 5.6.1 static lib

All the libs are build with MinGW GCC 4.6.2

Have Fun!
